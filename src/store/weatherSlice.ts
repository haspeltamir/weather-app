Redux Slice:
  My Explanation:
    "Slice": in Redux, is a collection of reducer functions and actions for a specific feature 
      in your application.
    
    "createSlice": is a function that takes an initial state, an object full of reducer functions,
      and a "slice name", in order to generates a slice object that 
      contains the generated reducer functions as well as action creators
    
    "Reducers": are functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
    
    "Actions": are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.
